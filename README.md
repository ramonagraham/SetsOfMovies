# SetsOfMovies
Created for my class assignment, IT 333
This project contains three files:  Movie class, MovieDriver class, and SetHelper class.
This project creates Movie objects (name and year), Sets (movie categories): unions, intersections, symmetric difference, helper class, Map, then provides an output of selective lists.
(My first personal repository!)
